// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
//   console.log(cohort.length)

a) Your answer: This will log the amount of text in the string LEARN 2022.
b) Verify and explain: This logged 10 the amount of text in the string because of the .length property.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
//   console.log(greeting[4])

a) Your answer: This will log the letter o in Hello.
b) Verify and explain: This logged the letter o in Hello because the index [4] was called in the const greeting.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
//   console.log(languages[index])

a) Your answer: This will log Ruby.
b) Verify and explain: This logged Ruby because the const index was called and called the string located at index 1 of the array.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
//  console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

a) Your answer: This will turn the text into uppercase.
b) Verify and explain: This logged a TypeError: weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
//  console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

a) Your answer: This will log the data types of the array and also log the length of each one.
b) Verify and explain: This logged the string number because of the typeof operator.
